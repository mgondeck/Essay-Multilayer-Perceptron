# Artificial Neural Network: Multilayer-Perceptron

## Introduction
This repository contains the LaTeX source files for an essay I have written for the purpose of my application for the Master's degree at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 
I have chosen the topic of artificial neural networks because it is one of those that fascinates me very deeply, 
I have studied it in detail and I consider it important for my further education. 
It contains the foundations of neural networks and based on this, the principle of multi-layer networks as well as one well-known learning procedure.
    
The project is set up to work with Overleaf for easy online editing.
