    I have written this abstract for the purpose of my application for the Master's degree in Science, Business and Innovation at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I have chosen the topic of artificial neural networks because it is one of those that fascinates me very deeply, I have studied it in detail and I consider it important for my further education. In the following, I will discuss the foundations of neural networks and based on this, I will briefly describe the principle of multi-layer networks as well as one well-known learning procedure.
